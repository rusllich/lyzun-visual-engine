This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## PostHog analytics

The application initializes PostHog from `instrumentation-client.ts` before
React hydration. It captures pageviews, page leave events, browser exceptions,
CTA clicks, and the AXIS CRM demo conversion without blocking the UI when
analytics is unavailable.

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and provide the project values:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY=phc_your_project_token
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST=https://eu.i.posthog.com
```

Add the same variables to the deployment environment. The browser project
token is intentionally configured through environment variables and no private
API key belongs in the repository. See the official
[PostHog Next.js guide](https://posthog.com/docs/libraries/next-js).
